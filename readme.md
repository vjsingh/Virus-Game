## Background
Virion was the winner of the 2011 [Hidden Agenda] (https://twitter.com/haproject) educational game competition. The game is intended to teach kids (or adults!) about the basic workings of the human immune system.  

Players who fully grasp the mechanics of the game will also have absorbed a general intuition about the first line of defence in our bodies, including macrophages, antibodies, T-Cells, and granulocytes.  

## Getting the code up and running
Ignore everything not in the fb/ directory. Start a server in the fb/ directory, which is needed since we serve images and sound files with PHP.  

Yu can do this on a mac by starting web sharing in system preferences, and then creating a symlink with something like 'ln -s ~/Github/Virus-Game ~/Sites/virus-game'.

Then, just go to index1.html. (on a mac, something like this http://new-host-3.home/~<Username>/virusgame/fb/index1.html -- you can find your url in web sharing in system preferences).  

Happy gaming!
